# MyReads Project

## A project for Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

### About this project
This porject is a bookshelf app that allows to select and categorize book one has read, are currently reading or want to read.
It is written in React and Javascript. There is also an API server and a client library provided.


## To start the app

1) Download the repository

2) Start the development server with `npm start` in your command line for the project folder

3) The app opens automatically in your default browser on a localhost

* NOte: Make sure Node.js is installed.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
